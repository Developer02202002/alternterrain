alternterrain
=============

A quad-tree based LOD (level-of-detail) terrain engine running under Alternativa3D 8, for handling large terrain environments. Also includes other terrain-generation utilities.

Code is already working, but concrete examples/utilities (to get you started with terrain generation/saving/loading) will be included soon.
